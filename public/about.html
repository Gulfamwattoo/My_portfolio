<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi there! I'm Ghulfam Hussain, a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning and data analysis.</p>

<p>This journey started with a thirst for knowledge, leading me to a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Central Punjab. My bachelor's degree in Computer Science from COMSATS University solidified my technical skills.</p>

<p>But knowledge is just the beginning. I've actively applied my expertise in various roles. I had the privilege of serving as a senior coach at the DigiSkills Training Program, where I empowered others with valuable data skills.  Furthermore, my freelance experience as a data analyst and lead generator honed my ability to solve real-world problems through data analysis.</p>

<p>Whether you're looking for someone to illuminate the power of data science through training or to leverage its potential for your project, I'm here to help.</p>
